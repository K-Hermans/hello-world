This repository introduces the user to GitHub

I am the user in this case! Hello! 
My name is Kevin Hermans and I have been introduced to GitHub by colleagues at the Eindhoven University of Technology.
For a while I always liked the idea of creating something with commands, but have not had the confidence or strength to start learning a new language. All things considered I decided to make the leap by following a very small introduction to C++ as well as doing part of a university subject in said language. This will also be what my GitHub primarily will be about the next few years.
